### Debugging the Extension

To debug the extension:

1. Ensure you've run `npm run compile` and `npm run build:webview` to build both the extension and UI
2. Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host
3. In the Extension Development Host window, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
4. Run the command "Open AI Chat" to launch the extension
5. Set breakpoints in your TypeScript files to debug the extension code

If you encounter issues when pressing F5:
- Make sure the `.vscode/launch.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json` files are properly configured
- Check that all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
- Verify that the extension has been compiled with `npm run compile`
- If you see React syntax errors, ensure the webview-ui has proper TypeScript configuration files (tsconfig.json and tsconfig.node.json)

### Build Commands

- `npm run compile`: Build the extension
- `npm run watch`: Watch for changes
- `npm run build:webview`: Build React UI
- `npm run dev:webview`: Watch React UI changes

### WebView Communication

The extension uses VS Code's WebView API for communication between the extension host and React UI:

- Extension â†’ WebView: `webview.postMessage()`
- WebView â†’ Extension: `vscode.postMessage()`
